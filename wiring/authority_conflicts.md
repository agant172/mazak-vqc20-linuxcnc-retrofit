# Authority Conflicts — VQC-20/40 Retrofit

**Status:** DOCUMENTATION REVIEW RESOLVED — physical commissioning verification remains pending.

This register reconciles the RC3A connector cross-reference with the current Mesa pin authority. The documentation conflicts have been reviewed and handled conservatively: contradictory outputs remain blocked until cabinet tracing confirms the final wiring. Do not energize affected outputs based on this document alone.

## 1. Gear-shift solenoids

**RESOLVED 2026-08-08 (see CSV GEAR_HI_SOL / GEAR_LO_SOL):** pg100 TB-51 (Dwg 4143075338) confirms wire 412 → SOL-12 → GEAR SHIFT HIGH and wire 413 → SOL-13 → GEAR SHIFT LOW; physical double-check complete. `gear-lo-sol` bound to 7i84U-A OUT8 in HAL 2026-08-09. Coil voltage/current measurement and RLY-1/RLY-2 fitting still required before energizing. Original conservative record kept below for provenance.

- Current authority: `SOL-13` planned high gear on 7i84U TB3 OUT7.
- Current authority: `SOL-12` planned low gear on 7i84U TB2 OUT8.
- New evidence: `connector_crossref.md` identifies wire 413 as `SOL-13 — Gear Shift Low`.
- Resolution test: trace the coil wire tags from RC3A to both valve coils; identify the valve ports for high and low; measure coil voltage/current; then update both rows together.
- Authority status: `GEAR_HI_SOL` remains `COMMISSIONING_PENDING` and
  `GEAR_LO_SOL` remains `HOLD_CONFLICT` in the current authority. Neither
  output may be field-landed or energized until the two coils are traced
  together; the asymmetric statuses record the current CSV rather than proof
  that high gear is known.

## 2. Tool clamp/unclamp valve

**Documentation status: CONSERVATIVELY RECORDED.** Physical valve topology and clamp-side path remain pending cabinet verification.

- Current authority: TB2 OUT9 and OUT10 were both associated with `SOL-10`, with OUT9 clamp and OUT10 unclamp.
- New evidence: `connector_crossref.md` identifies `SOL-10` as tool unclamp.
- Resolution test: trace the RLY-3 and RLY-4 load sides to the hydraulic valve, identify whether SOL-10 is single-coil or dual-coil, and verify clamp/unclamp prox behavior with pressure removed.
- Authority status: both TB2 OUT9 and OUT10 remain
  `COMMISSIONING_PENDING`. The physical valve topology is still a blocker;
  those statuses must not be read as permission to energize either output.

## 3. Magazine rotation direction

**COIL IDENTITY RESOLVED 2026-08-09 (see CSV MAG_CW_SOL / MAG_CCW_SOL):** SOL-8B = CW on OUT13, SOL-8A = CCW on OUT14 per pg91 Dwg 4143075332 + connector_crossref (alarm-table OCR was wrong). Both nets bound in HAL 2026-08-09. **Observed rotation direction remains PENDING BENCH verification** — do not land or energize either field wire until verified under controlled commissioning. Original conservative record kept below for provenance.

- New evidence identifies `SOL-8A` as CCW/forward and `SOL-8B` as CW/reverse.
- The current authority assigns proposed `SOL-8A` / `SOL-8B` identities to
  `MAG_CW_SOL` OUT13 and `MAG_CCW_SOL` OUT14. Both rows remain
  `HOLD_CONFLICT`; the names are hypotheses to prove, not direction evidence.
- Resolution test: trace the two solenoid wires and verify actual magazine movement direction with hydraulic power isolated or under controlled commissioning.
- Authority status: do not promote either direction row until this trace is complete.
